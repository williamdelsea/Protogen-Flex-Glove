Protogen flex glove is a peripheral for a protogen LED head that uses finger movement to control face gesture. The flex glove uses ESP32 based boards and BLE for communication.
An ESP32 is used as the bluetooth server and main microcontroller for the protogen head, and two Seed Studio XIAO ESP32C3 for the gloves.
ESP32-WROOM and Arduino ESP32 nano will be officially supported. Other ESP32 based boards should still work, but will need more tweaking with the code
